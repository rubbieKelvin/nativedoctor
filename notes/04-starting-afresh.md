we first need to define the schema for native doctor. apparently i'm tired of looking for a focusing on working on a gui/tui implementation, so i think i should focus on the cli implementation first and make it work completely.
like i said we first need to define the schema. after this we can try to create a new project with the command line. i will use clap for this approach.
